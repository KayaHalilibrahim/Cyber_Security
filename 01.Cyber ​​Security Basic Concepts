Cyber Security Basic Concepts

1.MAC Address = Physical Address = Hardware Address:
-It is a 48-bit address assigned by the developer of the Ethernet card.
-The first 24 bits indicate the company that produced the Ethernet card, while the last 24 bits specify the Ethernet card itself.
- MAC address is used for communication in local networks.

2.IP Address = Internet Protocol Address:
-Consists of 32 bits.
-Used for communication over the network.
-You can think of the MAC address as the face of the computer, and the IP address as its name.

3.Public Address = Public IP Address:
-An address assigned to devices connecting to the internet by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
-Devices connected to the same modem share the same IP address.

4.Private IP Address:
-It is the IP address that each system has in closed local networks.
-Unique within closed local networks.

5.Static IP Address:
-An IP address entered by the user.
-Used for IP addresses that need to remain constant.

6.Dynamic IP Address:
-An IP address automatically assigned from an IP pool for a specified period.

6.Elements of Information Security:
-Confidentiality
-Integrity
-Availability

Confidentiality: A concept that determines whether unauthorized access to information resources is possible or not.
Integrity: A concept that determines whether unauthorized changes to information resources are possible or not.
Availability: A concept that controls whether all functions of information resources can be accessed during the desired time.

7.Authorization:
-Defines the privileges of the person accessing a resource.

8.Authentication:
-The verification of the identity of the person wanting to access a resource.

9.Network:
Structures established for communication between at least two systems.

10.Topology:
Shows how devices connected to a network are linked and how they are connected.

11.Bus Topology:
Communication occurs over a single backbone.
The status of the line is checked to see if it is empty before transmitting data.
If the backbone fails, the entire network collapses.

12.Ring Topology:
Data passes through all targets on a network in a ring-shaped network.
If one device fails, the network fails.

13.Star Topology:
Communication takes place through a network device located in the center.
The most common topology.
If the central device fails, the network becomes unusable.
Adding devices is easy.

14.Mesh Topology:
A device connected to the network is linked to all other devices.
Used to prevent data loss.

15.Network Protocols:
Define how devices connected to a network will communicate with each other.
Each protocol has an associated RFC document.

16.OSI Model:
-A model for common communication between different systems and devices.
-Created to define communication between systems.
-Divided into 7 layers:
a. Physical Layer
b. Data Link Layer
c. Network Layer
d. Transport Layer
e. Session Layer
f. Presentation Layer
g. Application Layer

a. Physical Layer:
Doesn't deal with content; it shows how it will be transmitted.
Sends signals from one port to another.
Hubs operate at this layer.
Hub: A network device used to facilitate data transmission between network devices.

b. Data Link Layer:
-Frame
-In Wireshark, the term "frame context" identifies data in this layer.
-Transmits data in frame format, adding error control bits to packets from the network layer.
-Checks whether the frame is transmitted with errors. If there is an error, it regenerates the frame.
-Switches operate at this layer.
-Ethernet belongs to this layer.
-Operates using MAC addresses.
-Sends frames to the target MAC address.

c. Network Layer:
-Data is referred to as packets in the 3rd layer.
-IP, ICMP, and ARP protocols belong to this layer.
-Routers operate at this layer.
-The network layer performs routing when packets need to be directed to a different network.
-There are no port details in the network layer.

d. Transport Layer:
-Uses TCP and UDP protocols.
-Responsible for ensuring that the parts of data sent are correctly reassembled.
-Checks whether data is reliably accessed or not.

e. Session Layer:
-Manages the establishment, processing, and termination of connections between systems.

f. Presentation Layer:
-Ensures data is presented in the desired format.
-Coding, conversion, and encryption occur at this layer.
-SSL protocol operates at this layer.

g. Application Layer:
-Protocols required for communication between programs and applications used by users on the network.
-HTTP, FTP, SMTP protocols belong to this layer.
-Closest layer to the user.
