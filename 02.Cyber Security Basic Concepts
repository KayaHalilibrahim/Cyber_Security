IOT Protocols

-The Internet of Things (IoT) explains the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and sharing data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from everyday household items to advanced industrial machinery.

1.MQTT
-Used in automotive, logistics, manufacturing, smart homes, and transportation sectors.
-It is a standardized messaging protocol or set of rules used for machine-to-machine communication.
Provides bidirectional communication.

2.CoAP
-An application-layer protocol.
-It defaults to connecting over UDP and can optionally connect over DTLS.
-Provides a high level of communication security.

3.TELNET Protocol
-Uses port number 23 by default.
-Follows the client-server model.
-Used to connect one computer to another remotely to transmit commands and data.
-Does not encrypt incoming and outgoing data, making it less secure.
-In modern networks, SSH protocol is used instead.
-Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

4.SSH Protocol
-Uses port number 22 by default.
-Used for secure remote login and file transfer.
-Provides strong password, integrity, and authentication security.
-Utilizes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method for key exchange.

5.FTP Protocols
-Stands for File Transfer Protocol.
-Defaults to port number 21.
-Primarily used for file sharing.

6.SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
-Used for sending electronic mail.
-Typically operates over TCP.
-Users connect to the SMTP protocol via a TCP connection to send mail and authenticate.

7.DNS = Domain Name System
-Facilitates the mapping of device names to IP addresses on the internet.
-Defaults to port number 53.
-Can operate over TCP or UDP.
-Essentially translates specific machine names into IP numbers, which the computer understands.

8.TFTP Protocol
-An network protocol used for file transfer.
-Operates over UDP.
-Used for file transfer between TFTP server and client. The client requests to upload or download a file from the server.
-Notable for its simplicity and lack of features compared to other file transfer protocols.

9.HTTP Protocol
-A protocol used for communication of data on the World Wide Web.
-Defaults to port number 80.
-Operates with a client-server model.
-The client sends a request to request a resource such as a web page, and the server responds with the document.

Common HTTP Methods:
-Get: Used to request a resource from the server.
-Post: Used to create a new resource or modify an existing resource on the server.
-Put: Used to add a new resource or modify an existing resource on the server.
-Delete: Used to delete a resource from the server.
-Options: Used to query the methods supported by the server.

Request and Response Messages:
-Request Messages: Sent by the client to the server.
-Response Messages: Sent by the server to the client.

-HTTP messages consist of two parts, the header and the body.
-HTTP Status Codes:
1->Informational Codes
2->Successful Codes
3->Redirection Codes
4->Client Error Codes
5->Server Error Codes

-HTTP 1.1 is the most widely used version.
