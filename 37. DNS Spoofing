           *DNS Spoofing*
           
- We intervene between the user and the DNS, redirecting their requests to a malicious server.
- Ettercap is a graphical tool used for DNS spoofing.

Steps with Ettercap:
1. Open Ettercap with its graphical interface.
2. Open the DNS spoof configuration file with `nano /etc/ettercap/etter.dns`.
3. Add entries like: `www.google.com A <LinuxIpAddress>` to redirect requests.
4. In Ettercap, go to Plugins, then Manage Plugins, and start the DNS spoof plugin.
5. Start an Apache server using `service apache2 start`.
6. When the poisoned device visits www.google.com, it will be redirected to the Linux web server.
