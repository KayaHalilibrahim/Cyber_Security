                *When selecting a payload*

Staged payloads:
- have a / in their name.
Example: payload/android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
- They are smaller in size.
- They are less stable.
- They work within stages.
- They require files inside the stage.

Non-staged payloads:
- have an _ in their name.
Example: payload/android/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
- They are larger in size.
- They are stable.
- They don't work within stages.
- They can work independently.
