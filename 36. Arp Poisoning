                    *ARP Poisoning*

- Arp poisoning is a type of attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.

arpspoof Command:
- To perform ARP poisoning using the `arpspoof` command:


*arpspoof -i eth0 <ipAddress>


- This command changes the MAC address for all devices on the network.

Wireshark Analysis:
- In Wireshark, check the MAC address in the destination (dst) field. If the target device's MAC address matches ours, the ARP spoofing attack is successful.

Selective ARP Poisoning:
- To selectively poison the ARP cache for two specific IP addresses:

*arpspoof -i eth0 -t <ipAddress1> <ipAddress2>

- This command makes the MAC address of ipAddress1 appear the same as ours.

Enabling IP Forwarding:
- For the packets to pass through us:

*echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Reverse ARP Poisoning:
- To perform reverse ARP poisoning:

*arpspoof -i eth0 -t <ipAddress1> -r <ipAddress2>

- This makes packets going to both ipAddress1 and ipAddress2 come through us first.
